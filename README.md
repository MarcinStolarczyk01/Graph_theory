# Advanced algorithms and data structures
## Intro
This project is a collection of problems and solutions developed during my masters studies in the Applied Computer Science field.
Each of the four optimizations will contain a short introduction to the given problem, a solution description, and a script.
## Discrete knapsack problem
_Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible._

In my case weight were replaced by volumes. 
The optimization target is to find **the combination of given items** described by a random volume that **their cumulative volume is lower or equal** to knapsack volume.
