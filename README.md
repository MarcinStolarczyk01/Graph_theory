# Advanced algorithms and data structures
## Intro
This project is a collection of problems and solutions developed during my masters studies in Applied Computer Science field.
Each of four optimization will contain short introduction to the given problem, solution description and the script.
## Discrete knapsack problem
_Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible._

In my case weight were replaced by volumes. 
The optimization target is to find **the combination of given items** described by a random volume that **their cumulative volume is lower or equal** to knapsack volume.
